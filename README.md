## Hackaday Supercon 2019 Logic Noise FPGA Workshop

This workshop is essentially a secret introduction to low-level FPGA programming, using the excuse of building simple synthesizers / noisemakers.  We'll be building up two demo projects that hopefully also inspire you to take them and run with them.


## Projects

There are two cumulative projects here: 0 and 1. :)  The first gets your feet wet in Verilog in the friendliest way possible, while the second actually makes something cool with it.  

## Resources

We'll be handing out the toolchain on a flash drive in the workshop, but it's also [available here](https://github.com/xobs/ecp5-toolchain/releases).  The short version of the install directions are unzip the binary and add the directory it creates to your path.  It's cross-platform, and we'll be adventuring through installing it on whatever OS together.

There are tons of good resources out there for beginning Verilog.  I'll list some of them here.
